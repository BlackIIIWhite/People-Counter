# üë• People Counter Project

Hi! I'm **Amit**, and this is a practice project where I built a **people counting system** that detects and tracks people moving in a video stream.

## üìΩÔ∏è Project Overview

- This project is designed to **detect and count people in a video stream** using computer vision techniques.
- It uses **object detection and object tracking** algorithms to identify people and track their movement across frames.
- I integrated a tracking system inspired by the **[abewley/sort](https://github.com/abewley/sort)** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for real-time people tracking.
- The source video for testing the people counter is included locally as `people.mp4`.
- This is a **solo practice project** developed to strengthen my skills in computer vision and object tracking.
